Total final variants (slots): 724

Counts by num_regenerations:
  regen = 0 : 645
  regen = 1 : 79
  regen > 1 : 0

Pass rates by num_regenerations (verification_passed == True):
  regen = 0 : 0.409
  regen = 1 : 0.456

Average pre-verifier prob for FINAL candidate:
  regen = 0 : 0.504
  regen = 1 : 0.482

In slots where num_regenerations = 1:
  final = initial    : 1
  final = regenerated: 78

Pass rates within regen = 1 group:
  final = initial    : 0.000
  final = regenerated: 0.462

Average pre-verifier prob within regen = 1 group (FINAL candidate):
  final = initial    : 0.178
  final = regenerated: 0.486

Done.
